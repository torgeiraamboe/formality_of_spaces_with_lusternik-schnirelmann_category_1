# Formality of spaces with Lusternik-Schnirelmann category 1

### Abstract
It is a well known fact that formal dg-algebras admit no no-trivial Massey products, and it is possibly equally well known that the converse fails. We prove that by restricting to dg-algebras whose induced product on cohomology is trivial, we do in fact get this converse. This allows us to prove that spaces of Lusternik-Schnirelmann category 1 must be formal spaces.
