    It is a well known fact that formal dg-algebras admit no non-trivial Massey products, 
    while the converse fails. We prove that by 
    restricting to dg-algebras whose induced product on cohomology is trivial, we do in 
    fact get this converse. This allows us to prove that spaces of Lusternik-Schnirelmann 
    category $1$ are formal spaces.
