Massey products are partially defined higher order cohomology operations on dg-algebras
introduced by Massey in \cite{Massey}. Since they are only partially defined we need an 
easy way to package this information in. This is done through defining systems. Let $A$ 
be a dg-algebra and denote $\bar{x} = (-1)^{|x|}x$. 

\begin{definition}
    A defining system for a set of cohomology classes $x_1, \ldots, x_n$ 
    in $H(A)$ is a collection $\{ a_{i,j}\}$ of cochains in $A$ such that
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $[a_{i-1, i}] = x_i$
        \item $d(a_{i, j}) = \sum_{i<k<j}\overline{a_{i, k}}a_{k, j}$
    \end{enumerate}
    for all pairs $(i,j)\neq (0,n)$ where $i\leq j$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    The Massey $n$-product of $n$ cohomology classes $x_1, \ldots, x_n$, 
    denoted $\langle x_1, \ldots, x_n\rangle$ is defined to be the set of all $[a_{0,n}]$, 
    where $$a_{0,n} = \sum_{0<k<n}\overline{a_{0, k}}a_{k, n}$$ such that $\{ a_{i,j} \}$ 
    is a defining system.         
\end{definition}

For $n=2$ this is just the induced product on cohomology, up to a sign. For $n=3$ this 
is the classical triple Massey product. When we use the phrase ``all Massey $n$-products'', 
we mean all Massey $n$-products for $n\geq 3$. 

The fact that multiple cohomology classes can be in this set means that the product is 
only partially defined. If this set contains just a single class, then we say the Massey 
product is uniquely defined. What matters for us is when these products are ``trivial''. 

\begin{definition}
    We say that the Massey $n$-product vanishes if it contains zero as an 
    element, i.e. $0\in \langle x_1, \ldots, x_n\rangle$.    
\end{definition}
